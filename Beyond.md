* [HBP Neurorobotics Platform](https://neurorobotics.net/) - Use the Neurorobotics Platform (NRP) developed in the HBP to connect spiking neural networks to virtual and real robots. This enables you to conduct embodiment experiments on our High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. All this can be either done through an easy to use web interface or locally on your machine. That way you can build brains for bodies and bodies for brains.

* [simulate a worm brain](https://www.dexterindustries.com/GoPiGo/projects/python-examples-for-the-raspberry-pi/simulate-a-worm-brain/) - In this project, we show you how to simulate a worm brain with the GoPiGo and a Raspberry Pi.
