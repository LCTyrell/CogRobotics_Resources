## 3D Objects Datasets


## Simulated Robotics Environments

* [Ingredients for Robotics Research](https://openai.com/blog/ingredients-for-robotics-research/#requestsforresearchheredition) - OpenAI. We’re releasing eight simulated robotics environments and a Baselines implementation of Hindsight Experience Replay, all developed for our research over the past year. We’ve used these environments to train models which work on physical robots.
