* [Advanced Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDNJre23vqCGIVpfZ_K2RZs) -  DeepMind - University College London

## Meta Learning

* [Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs330/) -  Stanford. While deep learning has achieved remarkable success in supervised and reinforcement learning problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, and game playing, these models are, to a large degree, specialized for the single task they are trained for. This course will cover the setting where there are multiple tasks to be solved, and study how the structure arising from multiple tasks can be leveraged to learn more efficiently or effectively.
