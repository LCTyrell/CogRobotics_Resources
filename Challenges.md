* [The Robotic Vision Challenges](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/roboticvisionchallenges/) - Big benchmark challenges like ILSVRC or COCO supported much of the remarkable progress in computer vision and deep learning over the past years. We aim to recreate this success for robotic vision.

* [Meta-World: A Benchmark and Evaluation for Multi-Task and Meta Reinforcement Learning](https://meta-world.github.io/) - Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn. However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. We propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks, with the aim of making it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks.
