## End-to-End Machine Learning Visuomotor Control

* **End-to-End Training of Deep Visuomotor Policies (2016)**  
Sergey Levine*, Chelsea Finn*, Trevor Darrell, Pieter Abbeel  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00702) / [video](https://sites.google.com/site/visuomotorpolicy/) / [project page](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeplearningrobotics) / [code](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps)  
We demonstrate a deep neural network trained end-to-end, from perception to controls, for robotic manipulation tasks.

## Transfer Learning in Robotics

* **Stabilizing Off-Policy Q-Learning via Bootstrapping Error Reduction (2019)**  
Aviral Kumar, Justin Fu, George Tucker, Sergey Levine  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00949.pdf) / [Slides](https://sites.google.com/view/bear-off-policyrl) / [project page](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/12/05/bear/) / [code](https://github.com/aviralkumar2907/BEAR)  
Off-policy reinforcement learning aims to leverage experience collected from prior policies for sample-efficient learning. However, in practice, commonly used off-policy approximate dynamic programming methods based on Q-learning and actor-critic methods are highly sensitive to the data distribution, and can make only limited progress without collecting additional on-policy data. As a step towards more robust off-policy algorithms, we study the setting where the off-policy experience is fixed and there is no further interaction with the environment.

## Sim2Real Transfer for Robotics

* **Domain Randomization for Transferring Deep Neural Networks from Simulation to the Real World (2017)**  
Josh Tobin, Rachel Fong, Alex Ray, Jonas Schneider, Wojciech Zaremba, Pieter Abbeel  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06907.pdf) / [project page](https://sites.google.com/view/domainrandomization/) / [code](https://github.com/montrealrobotics/domain-randomizer)

## Computer Vision

* **6-PACK: Category-level 6D Pose Tracker with Anchor-Based Keypoints (2019)**  
Chen Wang, Roberto Martín-Martín, Danfei Xu, Jun Lv, Cewu Lu, Li Fei-Fei, Silvio Savarese, Yuke Zhu  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10750) / [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INBjNZsnfy4&amp=&utm_campaign=The+Batch&amp=&utm_source=hs_email&amp=&utm_medium=email&amp=&utm_content=83935678&amp=&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_JTX44Tr5rxTZtiAyi9Prra5Tk8FcYYC0_yU9iMuEPrxEQYXkF_nfE8WYcwDG6F445skSBH6Drt7EsyR-OlBffxYvBjw&amp=&_hsmi=83935678) / [code](https://github.com/j96w/6-PACK)  
We present 6-PACK, a deep learning approach to category-level 6D object pose tracking on RGB-D data. Our method tracks in real-time novel object instances of known object categories such as bowls, laptops, and mugs.
