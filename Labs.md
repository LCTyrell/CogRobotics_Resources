* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) - is a research laboratory based in San Francisco, California. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

 * [Google Brain Team - Robotics](https://research.google/teams/brain/robotics/) - Our goal is to improve robotics via machine learning, and improve machine learning via robotics. We foster close collaborations between machine learning researchers and roboticists to enable learning at scale on real and simulated robotic systems.
We're exploring how **to teach robots transferable skills**, by learning in parallel across many manipulation arms in our one-of-a-kind lab purpose-built for machine learning research.
